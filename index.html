      <h1>Welcome to build-a-wrestler!</h1>
      <h5>You can choose between 3 different weightclasses: cruiserweight, middleweight and heavyweight.</h5>
      <h5>Cruiserweights are the most nimble wrestlers. They have less health than the others but have a high relevancy due to their impressive athletic feats. They also lose health and relevancy at a slower rate than the rest.</h5>
      <h5>Middleweights does not have the most health or the most relevancy but neither are they the worst. They lose health and relevancy faster than cruiserweights but slower than heavyweights</h5>
      <h5>Heavyweights have the most health, the least relevancy and lose relevancy and health more rapidly than the others.</h5>

      <h5>When you have created your wrestler you can press "heal the wrestler" to give your wrestler 1 more health. You can also press "have a match" to gain 1 relevancy but at the cost of 2 health. Use these skills wisely to keep your wrestler healthy and relevant. When either health or relevancy goes to 0 your wrestler will "die"</h5>
